Network Traffic Analyzer (Python)
This Python-based Network Traffic Analyzer processes and analyzes raw network log data using object-oriented programming and regular expressions.

* Traffic Analysis: Identifies top source and destination IPs, tracks protocol usage distribution, and detects potential DDoS attacks using heuristic methods.
* OOP Design: Utilizes inheritance and polymorphism to efficiently handle TCP and UDP packet types.
* Error Handling: Implements robust exception handling for stable and reliable performance.
* Efficient Data Processing: Uses dictionaries and control structures (loops) to maintain IP frequency counts and analyze traffic patterns with speed and clarity.
