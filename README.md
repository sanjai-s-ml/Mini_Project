Analyzing Network Traffic Using Python
•	This Python-based Network Packet Analyzer reads network logs and analyzes packet data using regex and OOP.
•	It identifies top source and destination IPs, protocol distribution, and detects potential DDoS attacks using heuristics.
•	The system uses inheritance and polymorphism for TCP/UDP packet handling and manages errors via exception handling.
•	Dictionaries and loops are used to efficiently track IP counts and analyze traffic patterns.
